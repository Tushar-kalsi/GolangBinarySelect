# GoSelect

GoSelect is a Go application that demonstrates the use of assembly language to perform bit manipulation operations in Go. It includes examples of selecting a specific bit from a binary sequence and counting trailing zeros in a 64-bit integer.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the Go programming language installed on your system.

2. Build and run the GoSelect application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go


This will execute the select_u64 function, which selects a specific bit from a binary sequence and prints the result.

1. The TrailingZeros64 function counts and prints the number of trailing zeros in a 64-bit integer. You can call this function from your own code as needed.


##  How It Works
 select_u64
The select_u64 function demonstrates the use of the "pdep" operation using assembly language to select a specific bit from a binary sequence. It takes a 64-bit integer and an index as input and returns the selected bit.


 `func select_u64(x uint64, i uint64) int`


 ## TrailingZeros64`
The TrailingZeros64 function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a 64-bit integer using an assembly implementation.

`func TrailingZeros64(x uint64) int`


### Benchmark results

The following are the benchmark results for the `Selectu64()` function:

| Benchmark | Nanoseconds/op |
|---|---|
| BenchmarkSelectu64AverageTime/Selectu64 | 234.4 |

This means that it takes an average of 234.4 nanoseconds to run the `Selectu64()` function.

### Device details for ARM processors

The following is a table of device details for ARM processors:

| Device | Processor | Architecture | Fabrication process | Core count | Clock speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Apple A16 Bionic | A16 Bionic | 64-bit | 4nm | 6 | Up to 3.46 GHz |
| Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 | Kryo 780 | 64-bit | 4nm | 8 | Up to 3.2 GHz |
| MediaTek Dimensity 9200 | Cortex-X3 | 64-bit | 4nm | 8 | Up to 3.05 GHz |
| Samsung Exynos 2300 | Cortex-X1 | 64-bit | 4nm | 8 | Up to 3.0 GHz |
| Google Tensor G2 | Cortex-X1 | 64-bit | 5nm | 8 | Up to 2.8 GHz |

This table is just a sample, and there are many other ARM processors available on the market. The specific device details will vary depending on the specific processor and device.

Please note that the clock speed is not the only factor that determines the performance of a processor. Other factors, such as the number of cores, the architecture, and the fabrication process, also play a role.
